## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive mobile view
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to implement media queries and background images in a project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
```html
<img src="bg-pattern-card.svg" alt="pattern card" class="pattern">
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  main {
    width: 90%;
    height: auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to implement the media queries in subsequent frontend mentor challenges I'll undertake in future
